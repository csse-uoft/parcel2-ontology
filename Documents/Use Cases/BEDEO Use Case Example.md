### Request for Proposals Development Opportunities (United Church)
UCC recognizes that there is significant potential value within its real estate assets. UCC anticipates
that up to 1,000 of those sites may close or restructure ministerial activities in those locations in the
near future. As a result, the church wishes to plan effectively for the future, and by definition, needs
to be cognisant of the inherent value in the real estate and how that value may contribute to the ongoing mission of the church.

The UCC has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, called the United Property Resource
Corporation (UPRC) to assist the church in real estate matters and ensure optimal value is realized,
site by site. In effect, the UPRC is meant to act as the flow through vehicle to expedite decision
making and project flow, funnel future project opportunities, and add confidence with professional
real estate staff. In this respect, this RFP document represents the first group of properties to be
offered to the development industry by UPRC for market real estate development and, where
possible, to contribute non-monetary enhancements to the mission of the church.

Where feasible, the church would like to see affordable housing as a dominant objective site by
site, recognizing that this is to be balanced against required market housing returns to ensure a
financially feasible development partnership with the industry. In addition, UCC may request to
continue to ensure an ownership position in the development of a project so that it might sustain
on-going mission in some locations.
