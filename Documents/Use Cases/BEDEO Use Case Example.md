Description 
The Bowmanville Redevelopment Project is to be delivered under the Design-Build-Finance (DBF) delivery model to Lakeridge Health. 
Lakeridge Health is a healthcare network of 5 community hospitals and several outreach community and residential programs. Lakeridge Health Bowmanville Hospital is an important component of an integrated approach to healthcare for the Durham Region. With the region’s population growing to almost one million over the next 20 years, the Lakeridge Health Bowmanville Hospital redevelopment is the first step in a cohesive plan to evolve into a stronger regional healthcare system, including enhanced scope of services, teaching and research. 
The Lakeridge Health Bowmanville Hospital was founded in 1913. In 1946 the Memorial Hospital Bowmanville opened as a new facility (North Wing), with an extension constructed in 1960 (South Wing). The East Wing opened in 1990 and the Level 2 Critical Care Unit and Regional Eye Care Centre opened in 2013. 
In keeping with Lakeridge Health’s vision, Lakeridge Health Bowmanville Hospital will continue to be a full-service community hospital while relying on its sister hospitals for higher-level tertiary care, inpatient mental health services and other regional programs.
